Following [LearnOpenGL course](https://learnopengl.com) from [Joey de Vries](http://joeydevries.com)

I am using this course not only to learn openGL but also as an excuse to learn how to use git and gitHub  
~~Already started a couple of weeks early so the first couple of commits will be fast~~  
This is the last version that i had made before starting with git
